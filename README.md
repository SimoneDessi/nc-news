Welcome!
Before running the project please configure the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
-Create 2 .env files (.env.development, .env.test)
-Insert PGDATABASE=name_of_your_database
-You'll find the database name on the setup.sql file
-Make sure after you add your database name on the env files to double check they are ignored through .gitignore

Happy coding ðŸ¤“
